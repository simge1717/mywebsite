                Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Simge, and I am originally from 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jRAQ_RC0QM">Adana</a>, Turkey, a city known for its rich culture and delicious cuisine. 
                I am currently pursuing my studies in Computer Programming and Analysis at Valencia College. 
                My passion for technology drives me to constantly learn new programming languages, explore innovative software solutions, and stay up-to-date with emerging trends in the tech world.

                Sports are also an important part of my life; I play badminton twice a week at the 
                <a href="https://www.orlandoracketsports.com/">Orlando Badminton Club</a>. 
                It's not just a way to stay active—it's also a great opportunity to meet new people and have fun.
            </p>

            <p class="printable">
                Family and friendships are central to who I am. I love spending quality time with my family and friends, 
                whether it's enjoying a meal together, exploring new places, or simply having meaningful conversations. 
                These connections give me support and inspiration in both my personal and academic life.
            </p>

                My professional goals revolve around developing strong programming skills and contributing to the technology industry in meaningful ways. 
                I aspire to work on innovative projects that make a real difference and continuously challenge myself to grow as a developer. 
                I firmly believe that in the fast-paced world of technology, continuous learning and adaptability are key to success.
