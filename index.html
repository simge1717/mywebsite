				Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Simge, and I am originally from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jRAQ_RC0QM" target="_blank">Adana</a>, Turkey, a city known for its rich culture and delicious cuisine. I am currently pursuing my studies in Computer Programming and Analysis at Valencia College. My passion for technology drives me to constantly learn new programming languages, explore innovative software solutions, and stay up-to-date with emerging trends in the tech world.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a variety of hobbies that help me maintain a balanced lifestyle. I enjoy reading books on technology, personal development, and fiction, which allow me to broaden my perspective and spark my creativity. Sports are also an important part of my life; I play badminton twice a week at the <a href="https://www.orlandoracketsports.com/" target="_blank">Orlando Badminton Club</a>. It’s not just a way to stay active—it’s also a great opportunity to meet new people and have fun. I often invite friends to join me, and it’s completely free for anyone interested!

Family and friendships are central to who I am. I love spending quality time with my family and friends, whether it’s enjoying a meal together, exploring new places, or simply having meaningful conversations. These connections give me support and inspiration in both my personal and academic life.</p>
<br>

<p style="text-indent: 30px;">My professional goals revolve around developing strong programming skills and contributing to the technology industry in meaningful ways. I aspire to work on innovative projects that make a real difference and continuously challenge myself to grow as a developer. I firmly believe that in the fast-paced world of technology, continuous learning and adaptability are key to success.

This webpage represents one of my first steps in learning HTML and web development, and it reflects my enthusiasm for building digital experiences. As I continue to improve my skills, I hope to create more complex projects, share my knowledge, and inspire others to explore the world of programming. I am excited for the journey ahead and look forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie in my path.</p>
